CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "select" the HTML elements you want to style. Here are some of the most common types of CSS selectors:

1. Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all elements on the page.
Example:
* {
    color: blue;
}

2. Type Selector
The type selector selects all elements of a given type.
Example:
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}

3. Class Selector
The class selector selects all elements with a specific class attribute.
Example:
.my-class {
    background-color: yellow;
}

4. ID Selector
The ID selector selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
Example:
#my-id {
    border: 1px solid black;
}

5. Attribute Selector
The attribute selector selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
Example:
input[type="text"] {
    width: 200px;
}

6. Descendant Selector
The descendant selector selects elements that are descendants of another element.
Example:
div p {
    margin: 10px;
}

7. Child Selector
The child selector selects elements that are direct children of another element.
Example:
ul > li {
    list-style-type: none;
}

8. Adjacent Sibling Selector
The adjacent sibling selector selects an element that is immediately preceded by another element.
Example:
h1 + p {
    font-weight: bold;
}

9. General Sibling Selector
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
Example:
h1 ~ p {
    color: red;
}

10. Pseudo-class Selector
The pseudo-class selector selects elements based on their state.
Example:
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

11. Pseudo-element Selector
The pseudo-element selector selects and styles a part of an element.
Example:
p::first-line {
    font-style: italic;
}

These are just some of the many selectors available in CSS. By combining these selectors, you can target elements in a variety of ways to create complex and specific styles for your web pages.

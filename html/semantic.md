Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning of the content within them. These tags provide information about the structure and purpose of the content,
 making it easier for browsers, search engines, and developers to understand and process the webpage. Here are some key points about semantic HTML:

1. **Improves Accessibility**: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to better interpret the content, 
making the web more accessible to users with disabilities.

2. **Enhances SEO**: Search engines use the semantic structure of a webpage
 to better understand its content, which can improve the page's search engine ranking.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: Semantic HTML makes the code more readable
 and maintainable, as the purpose of each element is clear from its tag.

4. **Better Collaboration**: When multiple developers work on the same project, 
semantic HTML helps ensure that everyone understands the structure and purpose of the content.

Common Semantic HTML Tags:
- `<header>`: Defines the header section of a document or section.
- `<nav>`: Defines a navigation block containing links to other parts of the site.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of a document.
- `<section>`: Defines a section in a document.
- `<article>`: Represents an independent piece of content.
- `<aside>`: Defines content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
- `<footer>`: Defines the footer section of a document or section.
- `<figure>`: Represents self-contained content, like images with captions.
- `<figcaption>`: Defines a caption for a `<figure>` element.

Using semantic HTML not only improves the user experience but also ensures that your web content is future-proof and easier to manage.

**Inline and Block Elements in HTML**

- **BLOCK ELEMENTS**:
    - Start on a new line and take up the full width available.
    - Can contain other block elements and inline elements.
    - Common examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<section>`, `<article>`.

        ```html
        <div>
            <h1>Heading</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
        </div>
        ```

- **Inline Elements**:
  - Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
  - Generally contain text or other inline elements.
  - Common examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<label>`, `<input>`.

    ```html
    <p>This is a <span>highlighted</span> word in a sentence.</p>
    ```

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Display Behavior**: Block elements stack vertically; inline elements flow horizontally within a block container.
  - **Content Model**: Block elements can contain both block and inline elements; inline elements generally contain only inline elements or text.
  - **Styling**: Block elements can have width, height, margins, and padding; inline elements cannot have width and height set but can have horizontal margins and padding.

## Introduction

Logging is a critical part of any backend application. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the application's behavior. In this guide, we will use two popular logging libraries:

- **Morgan**: A middleware for logging HTTP requests in Express.js.
- **Winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js that supports multiple transports (e.g., console, file, database).

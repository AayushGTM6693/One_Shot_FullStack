## Git Basics

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It helps track changes, revert to previous states, and collaborate with other developers seamlessly.

### Installing Git
1. **Windows:**
   - Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **MacOS:**
   - Use Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```

3. **Linux:**
   - Use the package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install git # Ubuntu/Debian
     sudo yum install git # Fedora
     ```

### Git Workflow
1. **Working Directory:** Where files are created and edited.
2. **Staging Area:** A temporary area to prepare changes.
3. **Repository:** Where changes are committed and stored.

### Key Concepts
- **Repository:** A project tracked by Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development.
- **Merge:** Combining branches.
- **Remote:** A shared repository for collaboration.
- **Pull/Push:** Fetching or sending changes to/from a remote repository.

## Git Commands

### Basic Commands

#### Initialize a Repository
```bash
git init
```
Creates a new Git repository in the current directory.

#### Clone a Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Copies a remote repository to your local machine.

#### Check Status
```bash
git status
```
Shows the status of changes in the working directory and staging area.

#### Add Changes
```bash
git add <file>
```
Stages changes for a commit.

#### Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Your message here"
```
Saves the staged changes to the repository.

### Branching and Merging

#### Create a Branch
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```
Creates a new branch.

#### Switch to a Branch
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
Switches to a specific branch.

#### Merge Branches
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

#### Delete a Branch
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
Deletes a branch.

### Collaboration Commands

#### Push Changes
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```
Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

#### Pull Changes
```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
Downloads changes from a remote repository.

#### Fetch Changes
```bash
git fetch origin
```
Downloads changes without merging them.

#### Add a Remote
```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```
Links a local repository to a remote repository.

### Advanced Commands

#### View Commit History
```bash
git log
```
Displays the commit history.

#### Undo Changes
```bash
git reset
```
Reverts changes to a previous state.

#### Stash Changes
```bash
git stash
```
Temporarily saves changes not ready to commit.

#### Apply Stash
```bash
git stash apply
```
Reapplies stashed changes.

## GitHub Basics

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It provides tools for code review, issue tracking, and CI/CD integrations.

### Setting Up GitHub
1. Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. Set up SSH keys for secure authentication:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Add the generated SSH key to your GitHub account.

### Key Features of GitHub
- **Repositories:** Hosting and managing code.
- **Pull Requests:** Proposing changes.
- **Issues:** Tracking bugs and tasks.
- **Actions:** Automating workflows.
- **Pages:** Hosting static websites.

## Using Git with GitHub
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Link it to your local repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository_url>
   ```
3. Push changes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Collaborate using pull requests and reviews.

## Examples

### Initializing and Pushing a Repository
```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
touch README.md
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my_project.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Creating a Branch and Making Changes
```bash
git checkout -b feature_branch
echo "New feature" > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Add feature"
git push origin feature_branch
```

### Merging Changes
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature_branch
git push origin main
```

## Tips and Best Practices
1. **Commit Often:** Small, frequent commits make it easier to track changes.
2. **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:** Describe what and why.
3. **Use Branches:** Keep features and fixes isolated.
4. **Pull Before You Push:** Avoid merge conflicts.
5. **Collaborate Using Pull Requests:** Encourage code reviews.
6. **Back Up Regularly:** Push to remote repositories frequently.
